== Welcome to my Ember+Rails sample

This sample aims to provide a nice starting point to a web application that
uses Ember.js and talks to a server that provides raw data.

Rails will be used as the build process (as opposed to something like grunt or
yeoman. The expected production output will be a set of static assets which
will have been produced by Rails. These assets will then be placed into your
server.
